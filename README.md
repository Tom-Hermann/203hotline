# 203hotline

1. Compute the binomial coefficient $\binom{n}{k}$ fiven k and n

2. Compare the binomial and Poisson distrubution given the average duration of calls, by printing:
   - the probabilities of getting nsimultaneous calls (for nincreasing from 0 to 50),
   - the probability of an overload,
   - the computation time.
